## Dataset

Ford GoBike is a regional public bicycle sharing system in the San Francisco Bay Area, California. Over the past decade, bicycle-sharing systems have been growing in number and popularity in cities across the world. Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles for short trips, typically 30 minutes or less.In this project, I will perform an exploratory analysis on data provided by Ford GoBike service provider.

In this project, we will focus on the record of individual trips taken in from January 2018 to April 2019.
